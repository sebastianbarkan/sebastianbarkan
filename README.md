Hey there,

I'm @sebastianbarkan, what particularly interests me is the process of refining and iterating innovative projects to a level that at the end of the day I can look back at and be proud of. Right now my main tools are Next.js, Typescript, Express and MySQL, which I'm currently using to build a cool project called Daobase, an aggregate for the DAO space in order to centralize the information about the field and to provide the community with an easily navigable platform to explore, invest and stay updated. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js, Typescript, PHP and React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects that aim to solve a hard or interesting problem in a new way.
- 📫 How to reach me: sebastiandbarkan@gmail.com
- Thank you TANSTACK!
