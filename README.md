Hey there,

I'm @sebastianbarkan, what particularly interests me is the process of refining and iterating innovative projects to a level that at the end of the day I can look back at and be proud of. Right now my main tools are Next.js, Typescript, Express and MySQL, which I'm currently using to build a cool project called Planr, an AI powered itinerary scheduler that provides a fully fleshed out plan (including budgeting, routing, events and more!) for any trip you're planning. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js, Typescript, Solidity and React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects that aim to solve a hard or intersting problem in a new way.
